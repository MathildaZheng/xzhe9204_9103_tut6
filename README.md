# Quiz 8: Imaging and Coding Technique Inspiration

## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### Imaging Technique: **Double Exposure Effect**

One imaging technique that I find particularly inspiring is the **double exposure effect** commonly used in photography and films. This technique overlays two images to create a surreal and emotional composition. An iconic example is the opening sequence of the TV series *True Detective*, which merges landscapes with human silhouettes, producing an ethereal, dreamlike feel. I am drawn to this because it can communicate layers of meaning and emotion, making it visually engaging. For creative coding, this effect can bring complexity and beauty to an interactive project, especially when blending imagery dynamically.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

### Coding Technique: **HTML5 Canvas and Blend Modes**

To achieve the double exposure effect in a creative coding project, a great approach would be using the HTML5 `Canvas` element in combination with CSS blend modes such as `multiply`, `screen`, or `overlay`. These allow for layered visuals, where two or more images can interact based on their pixel data, emulating the classic double exposure aesthetic. By drawing images on the canvas and applying blend modes programmatically, the effect can be made dynamic, interactive, and highly customizable. This coding technique would be instrumental in creating a responsive, layered visual experience.

[Here is an example of canvas with blend modes in action](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/qBmbyXR).
